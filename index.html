        <p>Jigglypuff is a Normal/Fairy type Pokémon known for its ability to sing a soporific lullaby. Its song can cause anyone who hears it to fall into a deep sleep, especially after it inflates its large, wavering eyes and sings a melody that matches the brain waves of a sleeping person. It evolves from Igglybuff and into Wigglytuff. </p>
        <p>Komala is a Normal-type Pokémon that spends its entire life asleep, a state caused by the sedative leaves it eats. It is born asleep and dies asleep, often clinging to a log it was given at birth. Its drool can be diluted to create a potent anesthetic, and its sole ability is Comatose, which makes it immune to status conditions like sleep  </p>
