        <p>Litten, a Fire-type starter Pokémon from the Alola region, is known as the Fire Cat Pokémon. It's a cool-headed Pokémon that grooms its oily, flammable fur and then ingests the collected fur to fuel fire-based attacks. Litten's emotions are not easily shown, requiring time and trust to form a bond with people. </p>
        <p>Froakie is the Bubble Frog Pokémon, a Water-type known for secreting flexible bubbles from its chest and back that protect it from attacks and act as a cushion, allowing it to move with surprising speed and high jumps despite its innocent appearance. These "frubbles" can also be used offensively by jumping and throwing them at enemies. </p>
