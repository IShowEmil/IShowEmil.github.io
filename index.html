        <p>Tyranitar is an Armor Pokémon that is a Rock/Dark-type Pokémon with National Pokédex number #248. Known for its immense power, Tyranitar can cause massive destruction, like toppling mountains, and its behavior is often described as violent. It can also summon a sandstorm with its ability, Sand Stream.  </p>
        <p>Drifloon is a Ghost/Flying-type Pokémon formed from the spirits of people and Pokémon, known for its ability to float and a folktale that it abducts children by mistaking them for balloons, though it lacks the strength to actually carry them away. It's often described as a "Signpost for Wandering Spirits" due to its aimless drifting, and an old legend says any child who holds onto it could end up missing.  </p>
