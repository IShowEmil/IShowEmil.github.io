        <p>Necrozma is a Psychic-type Pokémon from another world that survives by absorbing light, which is the source of its energy. If it doesn't absorb enough light, it becomes darkened and sluggish, or it may go on a rampage to seek it out. Its various forms are Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma, and it can also transform into Ultra Necrozma. 
        <p> Lunala is the "Moone Pokémon" of Psychic/Ghost-type, known as "the beast that calls the moon" in ancient writings, that absorbs light to convert it into energy. It can obscure the sky with darkness, and when it spreads its wings, it resembles the night sky and can travel to other worlds by opening a third eye and creating Ultra Wormholes. When its third eye activates, it flies to another world.  </p>
